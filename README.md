# AR Hack

1. Clone and install this repo.
2. Print off a Hiro marker from here: https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg
3. Run 'npm start'. This will open a browser window on localhost: 8080 with your camera. You may have to click to allow access to your camera.
4. Hold the Hiro marker up to your camera. You should now see a 3D model of a fridge appear on your screen.
